This project evaluates the performance of DFS, BFS, and A* algorithms with four di￿erent heuristics (Manhattan, Diagonal, Euclidean, and Euclidean squared) on the Snake game. The study analyzes the algorithms based on time to completion, the number of actions needed to reach the goal, and two calculated scores: food per actions score and food per time score. The study was conducted by executing the program ten times and gathering data to compute the average performance metrics. The results show that each algorithm has its strengths and weaknesses, and the best algorithm de- pends on the speci￿c requirements of the problem. Overall, BFS performed the best on all metrics, followed by A* with Manhattan and diagonal heuristics. A* with Euclidean and Euclidean squared heuristics performed worse in compari- son, while DFS performed the worst. The study concludes that if the goal is to minimize the number of actions required or the time it takes to reach the goal, then BFS is the best algorithm. A* with Manhattan and diagonal heuristics would also be suitable algorithms to choose for this problem. A* with Euclidean heuristic would be an appropriate choice if time to completion and number of actions required do not need to be optimal, but A* with Euclidean squared distance heuristic is not recommended as it often overestimates the true distance. DFS does not appear to be a good choice for a path￿nding algorithm in the Snake game.
